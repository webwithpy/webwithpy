### Welcome to WebWithPy's documentation
---
Webwithpy is a webframework with speed and simplicity in mind, the goal of webwithpy is to become
one of the fastest web-frameworks out there. Making a website nowadays is pretty simple, however
most of the webframeworks are really easy to use but also really slow. And the other frameworks are pretty fast but
don't have alot of tools included which make a framework easy to use, or even they simply don't work!
This is the main reason behind webwithpy and why I'm currently making it.

            Webwithpy makes it so that most of the work is already done for you and almost the only thing you
            need to worry about is how you want to build and not anything that needs to be done around that.

        <p class="card-text">
            Webwithpy has its own custom orm build in called sqp. this is at the moment of writing the fastest pythonic
            orm. The current speeds go from a couple ms faster to 2-5x as fast. Why is this useful tho? well for 
            keeping server costs down and making your webpage load even faster so customers are happy.

            the pyht parser is build, so you can access back-end variables in your webpage and ofcourse run python
            in your webpage. It also allows you to import other html files, use code blocks and much more!

            If you have an idea that you want to bring to reality fast, this is the framework to use! It will allow you
            to bring almost any idea into reality in a short period of time. Now if you have multiple idea's it won't
            take weeks to build!
